  <h6>Anna</h6>
    <p>My name is Anna Sasso and I am in the class of 2020. I am from New Hampshire and have lived in New England my whole life. I joined EC Radio to share my music with listeners and to hear what other people had to play. I enjoy listening to Cage The Elephant, Frank Ocean, Amy Winehouse, and Alt-J.</p>
  <h6>Lindsay</h6>
    <p>My name is Lindsay Fucile, class of 2020 from Middleboro, MA. I love listening to most music, especially alternative and indie. I love makeup, iced coffee, popcorn, my two dogs and chocolate covered raisins. I spend my money on concerts like it's water (it's really bad) I'm glad to be sharing my favorite music with EC community!</p>

  <h2>Jaime and Fay's Radio Show</h2>
  <h5>7:00 - 8:00pm</h5>
  <p>Jaime and Fay met by fate through Emmanuel College housing selection freshmen year. Although paired together randomly, they realized they had the same taste in music, films, and denim jackets. Their show provides a weekly playlist of music they listen to, including the best of alternative, indie, electronic, and era music genres, and reviews of concerts and events they have recently attended. They hope you enjoy listening to their show as much as they enjoy making it</p>
